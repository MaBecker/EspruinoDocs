In Bangle.js you may often want to store data over time, and then recall it
later on your PC. In this tutorial we'll talk about how to do that.

There's a [more general tutorial about storing data on Espruino](/Data+Collection) as well.

We'll assume you've been through [creating an app](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js+First+App)
already so you know what's involved in creating one.

For this example, we're just going to have a menu that lets you write your current
GPS location and time to a file along with a name (for example you could mark the
location of every tree you find by standing by it and choosing `Add Tree`).

**Note:** We've already added a `gpspoilog` to the [App Loader](https://banglejs.com/apps/)
for you, so while you can upload this code yourself you'll find it is already all available
for you.


Watch App
---------

This is the code for the app - the majority of it is just creating the menu:

```JS
var menuItems = {
  "":{title:"GPS POI Log"},
  " ":{value:"No Fix"},
  "Add Tree" : ()=>addItem("Tree"),
  "Add Gate" : ()=>addItem("Gate"),
  "Add Flower" : ()=>addItem("Flower"),
  "Add Plant" : ()=>addItem("Plant")
};

var menu = E.showMenu(menuItems);
var gps = { fix : 0};
var gpsCount = 0;
// Create the file in append mode
var file = require("Storage").open("gpspoilog.csv","a");

function setStatus(msg) {
  menuItems[" "].value = msg;
  menu.draw();
}

Bangle.on('GPS',function(g) {
  gps = g;
  gpsCount++;
  var msg;
  if (g.fix) {
    msg = g.satellites + " Satellites";
  } else {
    msg = "No Fix";
  }
  setStatus(" "+"-\\|/"[gpsCount&3]);
});


function addItem(name) {
  if (!gps.fix) {
    setStatus("Ignored - no fix");
    return; // don't do anything as no fix
  }
  // The fields we want to put in out CSV file
  var csv = [
    0|getTime(), // Time to the nearest second
    gps.lat,
    gps.lon,
    gps.alt,
    name
  ];
  // Write data here
  file.write(csv.join(",")+"\n");
  setStatus("Written");
}


Bangle.loadWidgets();
Bangle.drawWidgets();
Bangle.setGPSPower(1);
```

First we need to open a file, which is done with this line:

```
var file = require("Storage").open("gpspoilog.csv","a");
```

This opens a file in `append` (`a`) mode. If it doesn't exist, it is created
empty, but if it does then subsequent writes will go on the end.

And now, we just need to write data into the file in `addItem` using
`file.write`:

```
file.write(csv.join(",")+"\n");
```

A few things are going on here:

* `csv` is an array, so we convert it to a string using `join`, which
adds all elements together with a comma between them.
* `write` doesn't add a newline, so we need to add one with `\n` so
we can read the data line by line later.
* `write` also can't currently write the character code 255 (`"\xff"`)
in files, so you need to stick to writing text, not binary data.
* `write` writes data as soon as it is called - there's no need to `close`
a file when you're finished.
* A file created with `require("Storage").open` is different to one
created with `require("Storage").write` since it is designed to be
appended to. As such you can only access the files with `require("Storage").open`
and not with `require("Storage").write/read/erase/etc`

Ok, now this is sorted, you can upload the app, run it, and get some data:

* Open the [Web IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/) and connect to your Bangle
* Click the down-arrow by the Upload button, choose `Storage`, `New File`, and enter `gpspoilog.app.js` as the name.
* Click the Upload button to uplaod the app
* Now copy/paste the following into the IDE on the left-hand side. This will
create a listing for your app in the Launcher without you having to upload
it via the app store:

```JS
require("Storage").write("gpspoilog.info",{
  "id":"gpspoilog",
  "name":"GPS POI Log",
  "src":"gpspoilog.app.js"
});
```

Now, you can go for a walk - when you have a GPS signal you can start logging
some data by choosing `Add Plant`, etc from the menu.

Reading the data
-----------------

### With the IDE

The easiest way to read the data is to open the file in the Web IDE. This may
be enough for many of you:

* Click the Storage icon in the middle of the screen (4 discs)
* Click the 'eye' icon next to `gpspoilog.csv (StorageFile)` in the window
* You should now see the file contents, and you can save this to a file if you wish.

### In the app

You can access the data programmatically - either reading in chunks or line by line.

For example this code will write one line at a time:

```JS
var f = require("Storage").open("gpspoilog.csv","r");
var l = f.readLine();
while (l!==undefined) {
  console.log(l);
  l = f.readLine();
}
```


Reading with the App Loader
---------------------------

However, you can also add the loading functionality to the App Loader itself.

First, we'll need to add the app. This is basically as documented in
[Adding an app to the Bangle.js App Loader](/Bangle.js+App+Loader) with one extra
addition - a `"interface"` element in the JSON.

* Set up [your own App loader as described here](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js+App+Loader#enable-github-pages)
* Copy the directory `apps/_example_app` to `apps/gpspoilog`
* Write the JS file above over the top of `apps/gpspoilog/app.js`
* Change `metadata.json`, as shown:

```
  { "id": "gpspoilog",
    "name": "GPS POI Logger",
    "shortName":"GPS POI Log",
    "icon": "app.png",
    "version":"0.01",
    "description": "A way to log points of interest with their GPS coordinates",
    "tags": "outdoors",
    "interface": "interface.html",
    "storage": [
      {"name":"gpspoilog.app.js","url":"app.js"},
      {"name":"gpspoilog.img","url":"app-icon.js","evaluate":true}
    ]
  }
```

Now you need to add the 'interface' file - copy the following to `apps/gpspoilog/interface.html`.

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../css/spectre.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="data"></div>
    <button class="btn btn-default" id="btnSave">Save</button>
    <button class="btn btn-default" id="btnDelete">Delete</button>

    <script src="../../core/lib/interface.js"></script>
    <script>
var dataElement = document.getElementById("data");
var csvData = "";

function getData() {
  // show loading window
  Util.showModal("Loading...");
  // get the data
  dataElement.innerHTML = "";
  Util.readStorageFile(`gpspoilog.csv`,data=>{
    csvData = data.trim();
    // remove window
    Util.hideModal();
    // If no data, report it and exit
    if (data.length==0) {
      dataElement.innerHTML = "<b>No data found</b>";
      return;
    }
    // Otherwise parse the data and output it as a table
    dataElement.innerHTML = `<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>Lat</th>
      <th>Lon</th>
      <th>Alt</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>`+data.trim().split("\n").map(l=>{
      l = l.split(",");
      return `<tr>
      <td>${(new Date(l[0]*1000)).toLocaleString()}</td>
      <td>${l[1]}</td>
      <td>${l[2]}</td>
      <td>${l[3]}</td>
      <td>${l[4]}</td>
      </tr>`
    }).join("\n")+"</table>";
  });
}

// You can call a utility function to save the data
document.getElementById("btnSave").addEventListener("click", function() {
  Util.saveCSV("gpsdata", csvData);
});
// Or you can also delete the file
document.getElementById("btnDelete").addEventListener("click", function() {
  Util.showModal("Deleting...");
  Util.eraseStorageFile("gpspoilog.csv", function() {
    Util.hideModal();
    getData();
  });
});
// Called when app starts
function onInit() {
  getData();
}

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This does a few basic things:

* `onInit` is called when the page loads
* `getData` grabs the data from the watch
* `Util.showModal` displays a status screen when things are happening
* `Util.readStorageFile` reads the Storage file from the Bangle and returns a string containing its contents
* `Util.saveCSV` can pop up a save dialog
* `Util.eraseStorageFile` erases the file

For more information about the available functions you can check out
[the interface.js file](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoAppLoaderCore/blob/master/lib/interface.js).

To use your new interface HTML file:

* [view your personal App Loader site](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js+App+Loader#using-your-new-app)
* Click `Connect` up the top right
* Click `My Apps`
* Next to `GPS POI Logger` there's a down arrow icon. Click it
* It'll pop up a `GPS POI Logger` showing you the data you recorded
* You can now save the data or delete it from the Bangle

And that's it! When you have it working as you want you can even
[submit it to the official App Loader site](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js+App+Loader#submitting-your-app-to-the-main-app-loader-website)
