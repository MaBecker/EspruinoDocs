Word clocks display the current time by lighting up letters that spell out
the time in words. This tutorial shows you how to make a Tiny Word clock using
a cheap 8x8 LED Matrix and an Espruino microcontroller board:

[[http://youtu.be/NL0ehzrf1qQ]]


You'll need
-----------

![word clock parts](Tiny Word Clock/parts.jpg)

* An 8x8 [LED Matrix](/LED+Matrix)
* A [MDBT42Q Breakout](/MDBT42Q) board
* A JST connector and [[Battery]] (or other way of powering your board)
* A label printed with the 8x8 pattern of letters


Wiring Up
---------

Just connect the LED matrix to **any** available IO pins. For the MDBT42Q
it's best to position the board over the very top pins on one side, and then
push inwards. After a few attempts on each side you should have bent the pins
enough that both sides will fit onto the MDBT42Q.

![word clock assembly](Tiny Word Clock/assembly.jpg)

On the board in the pictures, I've also pushed the PCB downwards so that
it doesn't stick out of the side of the LED matrix.

As in the video, if your LED Matrix is different, you used different pins,
or wired it in a different orientation, check out the [LED Matrix wiring guide](/LED+Matrix#wiring)
for some code that'll work out which wire goes where.

**NOTE:** It's not good practice to connect LEDs directly to microcontroller
pins like we have here, **however** because the display is multiplexed we're
only turning LEDs on for a tiny amount of time, which is extremely unlikely
to cause damage to your LEDs or microcontroller.


Labelling the display
---------------------

![printed word clock label](Tiny Word Clock/label.png)

The PDF file that was printed for the word clock [is available here](/files/wordclock_8x8_label.pdf).

The label in the video was printed on an inkjet printer, however there is some
light bleed visible as black isn't entirely opaque. If you have access to one,
printing on a laser printer (or in the highest quality possible on an inkjet)
will help with this,


Software
--------

Just copy this to the right-hand side of the IDE and click `Upload`. When
it's as you like it you can just type `save()` on the left-hand side to save
the state permanently.

The current time will be lost if the board is powered off. In this case you
can use the [Bluetooth Time Setter](https://www.espruino.com/Bluetooth+Time)
page on any Web Bluetooth device (PC/Mac running Chrome, Android Phone, or
  iPhone running [the WebBLE app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webble/id1193531073?mt=8))
